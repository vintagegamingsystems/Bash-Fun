create-Recover-RAID5-LVM-Scripts

The initRAIDLVM.sh script creates a RAID5 Logical Volume.

The devices are hardcoded into the script. I will attempt to create a script that will prompt for user input.

The recoverRAID5LVM.sh script restores a RAID5 Logical Volume.

It is currently has device "/dev/sde" hard coded as the recovered drive.

Both scripts are a work in progress. They can be easily modified to fit specific devices within your environment.
